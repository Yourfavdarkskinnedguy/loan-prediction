# Loan Prediction System

## Overview
This is a **Loan Prediction System** designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on certain applicant features. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle, implements data cleaning and preprocessing, and utilizes a Flask API for backend integration with an HTML-based frontend.

## Features
- Predicts loan approval status based on user inputs.
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for improved model performance.
- Flask API for backend predictions.
- User-friendly HTML interface for data input and displaying results.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains features such as:
- person age
- person gender
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- person income
- Loan intent
- Education level
- Gender, and more.

**Data Cleaning Tasks:**
- Handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled numerical features for consistency.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Removed redundant or irrelevant columns.

2. **Scaling and Encoding:**
   - Normalized numerical data for consistency.
   - Applied label encoding for categorical variables.

## Tech Stack
